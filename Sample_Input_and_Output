Game Instruction
Step 1: The game will randomly generate four coloured pins.
Step 2: The codebreaker would have to guess all the pins' respective order and colour to win the game.
Step 3: There will be a total of 12 guess attempts.
Step 3: Each guess with both the correct order and the colour of the pins would return a red flag.
Step 4: Each guess with the wrong order, but the correct colour of the pins would return a white flag.
Step 5: Each guess with both incorrect order and colour of the pins would return a dash.
Step 6: Failure to guess the correct pins within 12 attempts would result in a loss.
